## Welcome!

This is the first post on my new blog. I'm excited to start sharing my knowledge and experience in web development and design.

### What to Expect

I plan to write about a variety of topics, including:

-   Frontend frameworks like Vue and React.
-   Static site generators, especially Eleventy which powers this site.
-   UI/UX design principles.
-   Tips and tricks for developers.

I hope you'll find the content useful and inspiring. Stay tuned for more!
