Abdullah was an interesting person to work with. The knowledge he has of nodejs is beyond anything what I could've wished for. he did not only complete my project but improvised into making it much better. Although he completed the project in a day, he did take efforts into multiple reworks without hesitation. I strongly recommend Abdullah for any projects that you give him.
