Smart Deals Finder is an innovative AI-powered deal comparison platform that revolutionizes online shopping by finding the best deals across multiple e-commerce websites. As a personal project built entirely from scratch, it demonstrates my ability to create a complete product from concept to deployment, integrating cutting-edge AI technologies with practical business solutions.

### What It Does
Smart Deals Finder analyzes product prices, reviews, and seller reputation to find optimal online deals. The platform uses AI to search and scrape e-commerce sites for product information, then ranks deals across multiple criteria including price, review count, and domain reputation. It serves both individual budget shoppers and business users like dropshippers and resellers who need frequent product searches and deal analysis.

### Core Architecture
The platform's core flow (processQueryCore function) follows a sophisticated 5-step process:

1. **Product Input**: Users input product queries into the intuitive interface
2. **AI-Powered Search**: Advanced AI algorithms search for matching products across multiple websites
3. **Data Collection**: Web scraping gathers comprehensive product data using proxy support for reliability
4. **Reputation Analysis**: Sophisticated algorithms evaluate domain trustworthiness and seller reputation
5. **Deal Ranking**: Intelligent ranking system finds best options based on multiple criteria

### Technology Stack
The frontend uses React Router v7 with Vite for optimal performance and Tailwind CSS v4 for modern, responsive styling. The backend leverages Node.js with custom AI services and robust scraping capabilities. Data management is handled through SQLite with Drizzle ORM for efficient database operations. The architecture features file-based routing with clear separation of services and utilities, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

### Monetization Strategy
The platform implements a dual monetization model:

- **Free Tier**: 3 credits upon signup to let users experience the service
- **Pay-as-you-go**: $0.50 per search with volume discounts for heavy users
- **Monthly Subscriptions**: $29/month for 50 searches or $49/month for 150 searches

This flexible pricing structure accommodates both casual shoppers and power users, with paddle integration ensuring secure and reliable payment processing.
