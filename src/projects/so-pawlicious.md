**So Pawlicious** is a unique platform designed to empower pet owners to craft high-quality, nutritious meals for their dogs from the comfort of their own kitchens. Recognizing that pet food can be prohibitively expensive in certain regions, we built this platform to provide a cost-effective, accessible solution by curating recipes with easily accessible ingredients. Anyone can sign up, share their recipes, and become a content creator—known on the platform as a "Chef." Some Chefs can even offer subscription-based access, allowing them to generate income through monthly fees for exclusive recipe content.

The platform's home page is designed with ease of use in mind, featuring an intuitive layout that helps users quickly find and explore recipes.

For Chefs, the dashboard is packed with essential analytics tools that reveal audience preferences and engagement, allowing them to tailor their recipes accordingly.

To enhance their reach, Chefs have access to integrated marketing tools, enabling them to cross-post, share, and promote content across social media platforms, complete with real-time performance analytics.

Adding recipes is a seamless, user-friendly process, where Chefs can create content using just a few button clicks and minimal text input, making the platform accessible to users with any level of technical skill.

A live preview feature provides instant feedback on the recipe's final appearance, ensuring that Chefs have full control over their content’s visual appeal.

In developing **So Pawlicious**, I employed a range of technologies, including **ExpressJS**, **TypeScript React (Vite)**, **SwiperJS**, **ReactSpring**, **UnoCSS**, **Zustand**, **EditorJS**, and **AWS**, alongside tools for authentication and data management like **Redis**, **PassportJS**, **Zod**, and **Sequelize** with **MySQL**.
