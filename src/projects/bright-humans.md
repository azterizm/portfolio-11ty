Bright Humans is a state-of-the-art online tutoring platform established in 2025, designed to
revolutionize the way students connect with private tutors. The platform facilitates both online and
in-person sessions across an expansive range of subjects, from academic disciplines like mathematics and
languages to creative arts, cooking, music, professional development, and sports. It streamlines the
entire tutoring process, from discovering expert tutors and seamless communication to booking sessions,
secure payment processing, and a structured compensation model for tutors based on bookings and monthly
fees.

## Project Goal

The primary objective was to build a comprehensive, user-centric platform that efficiently connects
clients with qualified expert tutors. This involves creating intuitive search and communication tools, a
robust booking system, and a secure payment infrastructure. A key goal was to offer a diverse subject
catalog, ensuring accessibility for a wide array of learning needs, while also implementing a
sustainable financial model that supports tutors through commissions and tiered fees.

## Key Challenges

Developing Bright Humans involved navigating several complex challenges:
-   **Dynamic Search and Matching**: Implementing an intelligent search and filtering system to
effectively match clients with the most suitable expert tutors based on subjects, availability, and
preferences.
-   **Secure and Flexible Payment System**: Designing and integrating a robust payment gateway (Stripe)
to handle secure transactions, manage commissions for the platform, and implement a tiered monthly fee
structure for tutors.
-   **Real-time Communication and Scheduling**: Developing a reliable real-time messaging system and a
flexible session booking and availability management system to ensure smooth coordination between
clients and experts.
-   **Scalability and Performance**: Ensuring the platform's architecture can support a growing global
user base and maintain high performance for all core functionalities, including user authentication and
notifications.

## Project Status

Bright Humans has been successfully developed as a fully functional and scalable platform. Core features
such as user authentication, profile management, tutor search, messaging, session booking, and
integrated payment processing are implemented and operational. The platform provides a seamless and
engaging experience for both clients seeking knowledge and experts sharing their skills.
