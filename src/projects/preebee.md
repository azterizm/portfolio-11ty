### Project Goals

Preebee was created with a singular vision: to democratize e-commerce and allow everyone to create their own shop without the typical barriers of cost and technical complexity. Our mission is to make online selling as easy as possible. With Preebee, users can escape from time-consuming and repetitive tasks like negotiating individually with each customer or managing orders via messaging apps. Instead, Preebee consolidates these functions into a single, streamlined platform, enabling sellers to focus on what they do best: selling.

Preebee also aims to extend reach beyond traditional e-commerce by integrating product sharing across platforms. Sellers can now connect to customers through multiple channels, including live streaming, enhancing visibility and accessibility in ways that traditional methods don’t easily allow. The ambition here is not just to build an e-commerce platform but to create a tool that brings efficiency, simplicity, and expanded reach into a single interface.

### The Challenges Behind the Platform

Building Preebee came with its own set of unique challenges. The platform needed to be simple enough for users with minimal tech skills but robust enough to handle complex functionalities like automated customer interactions and real-time inventory management. This balance required careful design considerations, leveraging modern technologies to build a responsive and powerful backend while keeping the front end as user-friendly as possible.

Moreover, implementing features that enable real-time, cross-platform product sharing presented both technical and user experience challenges. Integration of live streaming as a sales channel required both smooth media handling and an intuitive way for sellers to present their products during a broadcast. Every component of Preebee, from the seamless product listing interface to the effortless customer interaction automation, was meticulously developed to ensure it meets the unique needs of sellers in today’s market.
