Genaro is a robust, full-stack studio management platform designed to seamlessly connect fitness studios, wellness centers, and educational facilities with their members. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools for streamlined booking, secure payment processing, and efficient class management, enhancing operational efficiency for studios and providing a superior, integrated experience for members.

## Project Goal

The primary goal was to create an intuitive and integrated platform that empowers studio owners to effectively manage their operations, from class scheduling and instructor assignment to comprehensive financial reporting and targeted member engagement. Concurrently, it aimed to provide members with a convenient web and mobile experience for discovering, booking, and attending classes, including automated reminders and access to recorded sessions, while simplifying the payment journey through secure integrations.

## Key Challenges

Developing Genaro presented several key challenges:
-   **Complex Workflow Orchestration**: Implementing intricate workflows such as dynamic waitlist management, multi-channel automated notifications (email, in-app), and robust role-based access controls for diverse user types (owners, staff, instructors, members).
-   **Secure Payment & Subscription Handling**: Building a robust and secure integration with Stripe for both one-time payments and recurring membership subscriptions, including the intricacies of managing refunds and discounts.
-   **Real-time API Integrations**: Seamlessly integrating with third-party services like Zoom for automatic live class hosting, meeting generation, and managing secure access to recorded sessions.
-   **Scalable Data Management**: Designing a performant and flexible database schema using Drizzle ORM to efficiently handle high volumes of bookings, memberships, complex class schedules, and user data, ensuring scalability for a growing user base.

## Project Status

Genaro has been successfully developed as a fully functional and highly scalable platform, effectively addressing the complex operational and engagement needs of modern studio management. It stands as a production-ready solution, offering a comprehensive and reliable system for studios to digitalize and optimize their operations efficiently.
