Welcome to **Eros**, a powerful and versatile ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system inspired by the functionality and ease of platforms like [Daraz](https://daraz.pk/). Eros is crafted to serve a variety of business roles and simplify complex processes through a suite of specialized applications. This system offers an integrated ecosystem where each role—whether buyer, seller, business owner, or delivery rider—has access to dedicated tools and dashboards. Through distinct URLs and well-defined role-based interfaces, Eros transforms how businesses and individuals manage, sell, buy, and deliver products.

## Project Goal

Eros was built with the ambitious goal of creating a highly modular and scalable ERP system capable of catering to diverse business needs under one umbrella. I aimed to design an interconnected set of applications where each module meets the specific requirements of different users, from customers and sellers to managers and delivery personnel. By prioritizing modularity, Eros ensures that every participant in the business ecosystem has an optimized interface and workflow, making their experience streamlined and purposeful.

Through this seamless integration, Eros empowers users with precise control over their roles while preserving a unified platform for managing the full lifecycle of a product, from listing to delivery. This ERP system is also an experiment in creating a "hub" where each user type, regardless of their technical proficiency, can comfortably and efficiently achieve their goals.

## Applications Overview

The Eros ERP system is designed around four core applications, each providing specific tools to its respective audience. 

### Marketplace
At the heart of Eros lies the **Marketplace**, an intuitive, customer-focused application where users can browse a variety of products, make purchases, and track their orders. The design is sleek, allowing customers to explore items with ease and facilitating a smooth checkout process that keeps them engaged and encourages repeat visits.

### Seller Dashboard
For vendors, Eros offers the **Seller Dashboard**—a powerful toolset that includes product management, inventory tracking, and analytics. This dashboard is built to empower sellers, giving them valuable insights into their sales performance, stock status, and customer preferences. From adding new products to monitoring ongoing orders, sellers gain an in-depth perspective on their business operations, helping them make data-driven decisions.

### Owner Dashboard
The **Owner Dashboard** grants top-level control to business administrators, including oversight of sellers, customers, and operations. Business owners can use this app to manage users, verify seller accounts, monitor overall platform health, and enforce compliance. This administrative control provides security and order within the Eros ecosystem, ensuring that all activities are aligned with business goals.

### Rider Dashboard
To facilitate flexible delivery, the **Rider Dashboard** offers a portal for individuals interested in taking up delivery jobs. This application lets riders sign up, track deliveries, and earn income through successful order completions. Designed to accommodate freelance or gig-based work, the Rider Dashboard supports independent riders, giving them access to earning opportunities with real-time tracking and performance metrics.

## Key Features

Eros leverages the power of modularity, enabling each application to function independently while seamlessly integrating with others within the system. With distinct URLs for different user types, Eros ensures a tailored experience without compromising on data consistency and integration.

Eros also boasts **advanced analytics**, particularly within the Seller Dashboard, enabling vendors to gain insights into critical performance indicators, such as stock levels, sales data, and customer engagement. For riders, the system provides a structured and flexible way to register, accept delivery jobs, and build a reliable income stream. These analytical insights and earning opportunities add substantial value for users at each level of the Eros system.

## Challenges Faced

Developing Eros was both rewarding and challenging. One of the primary challenges was ensuring a seamless user experience across multiple applications without diluting the system's modular nature. Creating distinct yet interconnected dashboards required extensive planning and testing to maintain consistency in the user experience while fulfilling each application’s specific purpose. Additionally, implementing advanced analytics across roles required building a robust data architecture capable of handling high traffic and complex queries.

Another significant challenge was integrating flexible delivery options for riders in a way that feels fluid and rewarding. Balancing real-time data updates, secure rider registration, and reliable delivery tracking was essential to provide a dependable service. Ultimately, we overcame these challenges by creating a system that adapts to various user needs without compromising on quality, security, or user satisfaction.
